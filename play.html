<p class="speech WINDERMERE">How do you do, Lord Darlington? No, I can’t shake
    hands with you. My hands are all wet with these roses. Aren’t they
    lovely? They came up from Selby this morning.</p>

<h6 class="name ">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>
<p class="speech DARLINGTON">They are quite perfect.</p>
<p class="stage-direction">[_Sees a fan lying on the

<p class="speech DARLINGTON">And what a wonderful fan! May I look at it?</p>

<h6 claas="name ">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>
<p class="speech WINDERMERE">Do. Pretty, isn’t it! It’s got my name on it, and
    everything. I have only just seen it myself. It’s my husband’s birthday
    present to me. You know to-day is my birthday?</p>

<h6 claas="name ">LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>
<p class="speech DARLINGTON">No? Is it really?</p>

<h6 claas="name ">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>
<p class="speech WINDERMERE">Yes, I’m of age to-day. Quite an important day in my

<p class="stage-direction">[_Sitting down_.]</p>
<p class="speech DARLINGTON"> I wish I had known it was your
    birthday, Lady Windermere. I would have covered the whole street in
    front of your house with flowers for you to walk on. They are made for
    you.</p>
<p class="stage-direction">[_A short pause_.]</p>

<h6 claas="name ">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>
<p class="speech WINDERMERE">Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the

<p class="speech DARLINGTON">I, Lady Windermere?</p>
<p class="stage-direction">[_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]</p>

<h6 claas="name ">LADY WINDERMERE.</h6>
<p class="speech WINDERMERE">Put it there, Parker. That will do.</p>
<p class="stage-direction">[_Wipes her hands
    with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]</p>
<p class="speech WINDERMERE">Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?</p>
