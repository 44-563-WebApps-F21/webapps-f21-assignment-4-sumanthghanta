<p>[LADY WINDERMERE _is at table R._, _arranging roses in a blue bowl_.]</p>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> How do you do, Lord Darlington?  No, I can’t shake
hands with you.  My hands are all wet with these roses.  Aren’t they
lovely?  They came up from Selby this morning.<br>

<h6>LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  They are quite perfect.  [_Sees a fan lying on the
table_.]  And what a wonderful fan!  May I look at it?<br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> Do.  Pretty, isn’t it!  It’s got my name on it, and
everything.  I have only just seen it myself.  It’s my husband’s birthday
present to me.  You know to-day is my birthday?<br>

<h6>LORD DARLINGTON.</h6> No?  Is it really?<br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> Yes, I’m of age to-day.  Quite an important day in my
life, isn’t it?  That is why I am giving this party to-night.  Do sit
down.  [_Still arranging flowers_.]<br>

<h6>LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  [_Sitting down_.]  I wish I had known it was your
birthday, Lady Windermere.  I would have covered the whole street in
front of your house with flowers for you to walk on.  They are made for
you. [_A short pause_.]<br>

<h6>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> Lord Darlington, you annoyed me last night at the
Foreign Office.  I am afraid you are going to annoy me again.<br>

<h6>LORD DARLINGTON.</h6>  I, Lady Windermere?
[_Enter_ PARKER _and_ FOOTMAN _C._, _with tray and tea things_.]<br>

<h6>>LADY WINDERMERE.</h6> Put it there, Parker.  That will do.  [_Wipes her hands
with her pocket-handkerchief_, _goes to tea-table_, _and sits down_.]
Won’t you come over, Lord Darlington?<br>
